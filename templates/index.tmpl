	<strong>Recent changes!</strong><br>We recently added Display Attributes so you can more easily find the information you're looking for.<br>
		The system has a lot of quirks internally so things may not display all of the Display Attributes you're looking for.  <strike>Most notibly on the flaylock and swarm launcher.</strike> <strong>Should be fixed</strong>
		These issues will be sorted out as soon as I can get around to it.<br>
		Thanks.
